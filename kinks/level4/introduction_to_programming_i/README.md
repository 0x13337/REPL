# Introduction to programming I - Reported problems
This page is about the [Introduction to programming I module](../../../modules/level_4/introduction_to_programming_i/).

## Sleuth cases
### 101, stage 3
- Use only `fill()` and `rect()` commands. You can adjust opacity with `fill()` by adding a fourth value like so:

    fill(R, G, B, A);

  where `R`, `G` and `B` stand for **red**, **green**, **blue** and can have values from 0 to 255 and `A` stands for **alpha** and is optional. In this case, a value of about `100` is fine so you can see through the shape being drawn.

### 201, stage 4
- Some students were given cases where body parts of the judge are missing (i.e., legs appear outside the canvas, for instance). In those cases, you may be better off just failing all your attempts and wait for a new randomized case to be given to you as you probably won't be able to get 100%.
- If your answer isn't accepted, try increasing the number of times you have `vertex()` in your code. Answers including at least 40 to 50 vertices have been reported to work better.
- You should only use `beginShape();`, `vertex(x1, y1);` and `endShape(CLOSE);` in your code.

### Other glitches
- Some cases ask to set the value of a variable to `mouseX` for instance and then make sure it doesn't go above or below a certain value with `min()` and `max()` functions. Answers can wrongly be accepted if you first set

      variable = mouseX

  and then reassign it by applying a function that is missing a parameter:

      variable = max(X)

  where `X` is an integer. The variable should be assign in one statement as follow instead:

      variable = max(mouseX, X)


## Week 1
### Lesson 1.1
#### Video: 2D coordinate system
- At 3:56, the top left corner should have coordinates `(4, 3)` instead of `(5, 3)`.
- At 3:56, the width of the rectangle is `12`, not `11`.


## Week 3
### Lesson 2.2
#### Practice quiz: Using the console and debugging syntax errors
- Question 3: "triangle" is misspelled â†’ `trinagle`, adding an additional error which is not an argument error. However, the spelling mistake shouldn't be taken into account.

## Week 7
### Lesson 4.2
#### Practice quiz: Conditionals with types
- Question 3: The question says the answer _"No, because  answer is neither a number, nor is it equal to the number 42"_ is correct. However the correct answer is _"Yes, because answer is equal to 42"_.
- Question 5: The question says the answer `parseInt(a+b)*c` is correct and the others are all wrong: however `(a+b)*c` is also correct. They both produce the same result.
