# Numerical Mathematics - Reported problems
This page is about the [numerical mathematics module](../../../modules/level_4/numerical_mathematics/).

## Week 1
### Video: 1.001 Introduction to number bases and modular arithmetic
- At 11:16, `(255, 255, 255)` is **white**, not blue.

### Video: 1.101 Introduction to number bases
- At 11:34: Wrong. Each column is a power of 60, so it should be times `1`, times `60` and times `3600`.


### Video: 1.107 Place value for fractional numbers: binary
- At 0:37: The "fractional point" is called "radix point".

### Practice quiz: 1.110 Rational and irrational numbers: decimal and binary
- Answers should be given without spaces.
- When a repeating fractional part is present, the answer should be written as `i.rr...`, where `i` stands for **integer part**, `r` is the **repeating** fraction and one must include three dots at the end. Example:

    3.12121212121212

  is written as
  
    3.1212...

## Week 2
### Video: 1.401 Octal and hexadecimal (integer)
- In the quiz at 3:41, the place values are supposed to be entered as "1, 16, 256". The answer isn't accepted.
- In the quiz at 4:24, 65536 should be written as 2^(16), but the "6" isn't part of the exponent part.
- At 5:07, second letter in hexadecimal should be "B", not "D".
- At 6:01, the hexadecimal number `11F` should have an expansion starting with `1 × 16^2`, not `1 × 16 (base 2)` as displayed.
- In the quiz at 6:29, the third answer is 256, not 64. The last part is asking in the quiz for multiples in binary while the answer is given for hexadecimal.

### Practice quiz: 1.404 Translate between decimal and hexadecimal or octal (fractional)
- `3.44` in octal is `3 + 1/2 + 1/16`, not `3 + 1/2 + 1/32`.
- Options may present groupings of numbers. If a grouping is supposed to be of **3** digits for instance and you're presented with **4** digits, assume that the last digit should be in subscript (representing the number base, such as **2** for binary or **8** for octal) so that it makes sense when reading. In a grouping of 3 digits, `0002` should be interpreted as `000`, base `2`.

### Video: 1.405 Special relationship between binary and hexadecimal, and binary and octal
- At 7:38, this is wrong. `C` (base 16) = 12 (base 10) = 1100 (base 2), not 1101.
- At 11:24, The grouping of digits is wrong.

    1.001.111 1

  in binary should read

    1 001.111 1

  having only one radix point.

- At 11:37, it is said the answer is `11.71` (base 8). Wrong: It's `11.74` (base 8).

### Practice quiz: 1.406 Translate between binary and hexadecimal/octal
- Question 6: `73.06` (base 8) *is* `111011.00011` in binary.

### Practice quiz: 1.602 Arithmetic in hexadecimal/octal
- `6D * 60` in hexadecimal is `28E0`.
- `6C * 3B` in hexadecimal is `18E4`.

## Week 4
### Lesson 2.2: Video 2.201 Arithmetic progressions
- The video doesn't match the transcript and is missing from the module. For now, the video can be downloaded [from this link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ct3v62zv1ka1pka/2_201_arithmetic_progression.mp4?dl=1). If you want to add subtitles, you can [download them here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/e73v0r27bosggqi/2_201_subtitles-en.vtt?dl=1).
  - If you don't know how to add the subtitles to the video, try with [VLC media player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) (free): open the video (`2_201_arithmetic_progression.mp4`) and from VLC, click at the top on `Subtitle`, then on `Add Subtitle File...` and open the subtitles file (`2_201_subtitles-en.vtt`). They will automatically be added and synced to the video.

## Week 6
### Lesson 3.1: Video 3.101 Cartesian coordinates
- There is no sound. For now, you can download the video [from this link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/922gj1vefoedx0y/3_101_cartesian_coordinates.mp4?dl=1). You can get the subtitles [from this link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/arvg0fuu7867vnl/3_101_subtitles-en.vtt?dl=1).
  - If you don't know how to add the subtitles to the video, try with [VLC media player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) (free): open the video (`3_101_cartesian_coordinates.mp4`) and from VLC, click at the top on `Subtitle`, then on `Add Subtitle File...` and open the subtitles file (`3_101_subtitles-en.vtt`). They will automatically be added and synced to the video.
