## JavaScript
### p5.js - JavaScript library
- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) - Official website to find [the reference guide](https://p5js.org/reference) and an [online editor](https://editor.p5js.org/) to practice. Next step: [p5.js libraries](https://p5js.org/libraries/).
- [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman/playlists) (playlists) - Channel from Daniel Shiffman, a board member of `p5.js`.

## Sleuth assignments
### Tips & Tricks
- Get familiar with finding precise coordinates in an image inside Brackets (text editor).
- Practice all basic drawing functions with `p5.js` in the [online editor](https://editor.p5js.org/) before attempting to solve crimes.
- You have a maximum number of three (3) attempts for each case: go ahead when you are pretty confident you are on the right path on your first attempt.

## Text editor
The recommended text editor for this module is [Brackets](http://brackets.io/). More options available on the [free software page](../../../software/).
