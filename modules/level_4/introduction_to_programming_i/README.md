# Introduction to Programming I
This module focuses on basic programming techniques. You'll learn
how to use the fundamental elements of computer programming such as
variables, conditionals, functions and loops. You'll learn how to
create interactive, graphical computer programs. You will also be
introduced to basic object-oriented programming techniques.

Enrolled students only: [Course syllabus available on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/london-cs-orientation/supplement/YUBNS/syllabus-introduction-to-programming-1-cm1010).

# Resources
## JavaScript
### p5.js - JavaScript library
- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) - Official website to find [the reference guide](https://p5js.org/reference) and an [online editor](https://editor.p5js.org/) to practice. Next step: [p5.js libraries](https://p5js.org/libraries/).
    - [Examples](https://p5js.org/examples/) are also available to get started.
- [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman/playlists) (playlists) - Channel from Daniel Shiffman, a board member of `p5.js`.

## Kinks to be aware of
- [List of reported errors and bugs with the module](../../../kinks/level4/introduction_to_programming_i/).

## On REPL (see relevant sections)

## Sleuth assignments
### Tips & Tricks
- Get familiar with finding precise coordinates in an image inside Brackets (text editor).
- Practice all basic drawing functions with `p5.js` in the [online editor](https://editor.p5js.org/) before attempting to solve crimes.
- You have a maximum number of attempts for each case: go ahead when you are pretty confident you are on the right path on your first attempt. You will have to wait a certain amount of time (about 24 hours) before you can attempt to solve the crime again.
### Utils and aids (student created)
- JavaScript library with visual aids for solving case 202 stage 4 [utils4sleuth.js](https://gist.github.com/amilos/beb1eee1cbd334f1e9abca8c9772c725)
## Text editor
The recommended text editor for this module is [Brackets](http://brackets.io/). More options available on the [free software page](../../../software/).
