# Numerical Mathematics
This module helps hone your skills in thinking abstractly. It also
introduces you to many of the standard continuous models used to
help understand and design computational systems. You will develop
the fundamental numerical mathematical tools that will support you
during the BSc degree. Particular attention is paid to notions of
experimentation, reasoning and generalisation. You'll learn many
of the numerical mathematical concepts and techniques that underpin
computer science. In particular, you'll study number systems, special
functions, graphing and linear algebra.
