# Algorithms and Data Structures I
This module will help you to develop your analytical and problem-solving
skills. It will encourage you to think about how to use computers to
solve problems. You'll develop skills in thinking algorithmically
and learn the central concepts of algorithms and data structures. You
will learn about linear data structures such as arrays, vectors and
lists and a unifying framework for considering such data structures
as collections. You'll study how algorithms can be expressed as
flowcharts and pseudocode and how to convert these into programs.
You'll learn specific algorithms used for sorting and searching,
and how to express repetition as iteration and recursion. You will
learn a simple model for execution of computation, and how to describe
computational problems and their solutions. The model will allow you
to compare algorithms regarding their correctness and regarding their
efficiency.
