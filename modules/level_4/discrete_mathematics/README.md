# Discrete Mathematics

This module helps hone your skills in thinking abstractly. It also
introduces you to many of the discrete models used to help understand
and design computational systems. Through this module, you'll develop
the fundamental discrete mathematical tools that will support you during
the BSc degree. Particular attention is paid to notions of
experimentation, reasoning and generalisation.

# Topics covered

- Sets
- Boolean Algebra
- Propositional Logic
- Predicate Logic
- Functions
- Recursion and Mathematical Induction
- Relations
- Graphs
- Trees
- Counting

# Assessment

One two hour unseen written examination and coursework (Type I)

# Resources
## Additional reading
- [A Guide to Writing Proofs](./resources/A_Guide_to_Writing_Proofs.pdf)
- [Discrete Mathematics Questions and Answers](https://www.sanfoundry.com/1000-discrete-mathematics-questions-answers) - *"Our 1000+ Discrete Mathematics questions and answers focuses on all areas of Discrete Mathematics subject covering 100+ topics in Discrete Mathematics."*
- [Matching (Graph Theory)](https://brilliant.org/wiki/matching) - *"Definition, terminology, bipartite matching, examples."*
- [Set Theory for Computer Science](./resources/set_theory_for_computer_science.pdf)
- [Solving Linear Recurrence Relations](./resources/solving_linear_recurrence_relations.pdf) - From University of California, Berkeley, [from this page](https://math.berkeley.edu/~arash/55/8_2.pdf).

## Essential reading
_"The essentials readings for this course will come from the following text book, which is  available in the University of London digital library:_

- **Kenneth, H, Rosen. Discrete Mathematics and its Applications. (2012) 7th Edition**
- **David Mackinson, Sets, Logic and Maths for Computing, Springer Verlag. 2012**

_This course does not require you to read the whole book, you will be given specific  readings for each topic from these texts are listed with direct links on the Readings page  for each topic. You will also be asked to do some independent research from online sources or using the University of London digital library."_

## Kinks to be aware of
- [List of reported errors and bugs with the module](../../../kinks/level4/discrete_mathematics/).

## Mathematical symbols
- The [list of mathematical symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mathematical_symbols) on Wikipedia is a handy reference. Chapter 1 of _Kenneth, H, Rosen. Discrete Mathematics and its Applications. (2012) 7th Edition_ is outside the scope of the essential readings for this module, but provides a solid foundation to understand the notations and some proof techniques used during the course.
- [Type mathematical symbols (online keyboard)](https://math.typeit.org) - Online keyboard to help with typing mathematical symbols.
