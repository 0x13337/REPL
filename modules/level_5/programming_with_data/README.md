# Programming with Data
This module demonstrates how to work with data: getting data from a
variety of sources, visualising data in compelling, informative ways,
processing data to make it useful and shareable, and reasoning with data
to test hypotheses and make predictions. The module also introduces you
to a new programming environment that is well-adapted to languages for
these applications.
