# Computer Security
The Computer Security module gives you
an understanding of the need for computer
security and the technologies supporting it.
It has both a theoretical component that will
teach you mathematical underpinnings of
security systems and a practical element to help
you discover the pitfalls of security design and
comprehend the mathematics underlying the
protocols by small programming examples.
