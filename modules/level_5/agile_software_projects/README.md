# Agile Software Projects
The Agile Software Projects module provides
insights and practice in software development
using contemporary methods to produce software
that meets the needs of users and supports
business functions. The module enables you
to gain competence in the conceptualisation
of a technology-based solution to a real-world
problem, fulfilling the requirements of users
while considering constraints imposed by market
conditions and lessons learned from prototypes. You
will then present a proposal for a technical project
including a plan for implementing the solution
using the agile development methodology and
test-driven development practices. From concept
to solution presentation, youâ€™ll be required to work
in a distributed team using online collaboration,
project tracking and version control tools.
