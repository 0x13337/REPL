# Algorithms and Data Structures II
This module provides you with detailed knowledge of common algorithms
and data structures. You'll improve your understanding of searching
and sorting and learn new algorithms to solve new problems. You'll
learn about a range of data structures such as trees, heaps, sets, maps,
stacks, queues and graphs. You'll also learn how to evaluate and
describe the performance of algorithms using big-O notation.
