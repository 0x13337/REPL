# Graphics Programming
Here you will learn how to work with images in a variety of ways.
You'll learn how to synthesise graphics and how to process visual
signals. You will learn about the mathematical ideas that underpin
digital representations of graphics; how digital media files represent
graphics, and how to handle and manipulate them, and the basics of
working with simulated physics and 3D graphics.
