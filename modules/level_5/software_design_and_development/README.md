# Software Design and Development
Software Design and Development advances your software development
skills so you can write more robust and complicated programs. You'll
learn how to use a range of programming techniques to deal with unwanted
or unexpected events that might happen when your application is running.
You'll use defensive coding to check data before processing it,
and exception handling to gracefully manage unforeseen occurrences.
You'll discuss program structure concerning cohesion (how to
meaningfully organise code into modules) and coupling (how to define the
interactions between different parts of the program). You'll learn
about test-driven development, where you write tests for your code,
and write the code itself, in parallel. You'll also learn how to use
versioning tools to manage the development of a software project.
