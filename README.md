A twist on the use of **REPL**, which stands for *read–eval–print
loop* in computer programming. This repository aims to become a central
place to share resources that other learners have found useful,
especially in the context of studying computer science at the bachelor
level.


## The Learning Hub for UoL's Online CS Students :school:

As the first cohort of students enrolling in the 100% online
[BSc Computer Science offered by Goldsmiths, University of London](https://london.ac.uk/courses/computer-science), 
it is in our interest to cooperate in order to maximize our chances of
celebrating all together when we graduate.

Good luck to all and may this path fulfill you, knowing that you will
find support along the way!
