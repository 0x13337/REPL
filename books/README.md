## Computer science
- [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/index.xhtml), by Harold Abelson, Gerald Jay Sussman and Julie Sussman (2<sup>nd</sup> edition) - *"An excellent computer science text used in introductory courses at MIT. So called because of the wizard on the jacket. One of the bibles of the LISP/Scheme world. Also, less commonly, known as the Purple Book."*

## Mathematics
- [Nix The Tricks](https://nixthetricks.com/index.html), by Tina Cardone and the online math community known as the MTBoS - *"This book is filled with alternatives to the shortcuts so prevalent in mathematics education and explains exactly why the tricks are so bad for understanding math."*

### Calculus
- [Calculus Made Easy](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/33283/33283-pdf.pdf), by Silvanus Thompson - *"Being a very-simplest introduction to those beautiful methods which are generally called by the terrifying names of the Differentia."*

### Discrete mathematics
- [How to Solve It - A New Aspect of Mathematical Method](https://lms.umb.sk/pluginfile.php/37176/mod_folder/content/0/Polya_How-to-solve-it.pdf), by G. Polya (PDF file)

### Linear algebra
- [Linear Algebra Done Right](http://linear.axler.net/LinearAbridged.pdf), by Sheldon Axler - *"The text focuses on the central goal of linear algebra: understanding the structure of linear operators on finite-dimensional vector spaces."*

### Number theory and algebra
- [A Computational Introduction to Number Theory and Algebra](https://shoup.net/ntb/ntb-v2.pdf), by Victor Shoup - *" My goal in writing this bookwas to provide an introduction to number theory and algebra, with an emphasison algorithms and applications, that would be accessible to a broad audience.  Inparticular, I wanted to write a book that would be appropriate for typical students incomputer science or mathematics who have some amount of general mathematicalexperience, but without presuming too much specific mathematicalknowledge."*

## Programming
- [Awesome Programming Books](https://github.com/majikarp/awesome-programming-books) - *"A curated list of awesome programming books."*
